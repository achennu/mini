Mini: Interpreter and a programming language implemented in Python
======================================================================

This is a branch where I tried to use 
`parsley <http://parsley.readthedocs.org/>`_ parsing library (instead 
of parsimonious).

I failed to implement the language so far, as parsley fails with
errors I cannot understand. Pull requests are welcome!
